## Keep Updated

If you have deployed your own project with just one click following the steps above, you may encounter the issue of "Updates Available" constantly showing up. This is because Vercel will create a new project for you by default instead of forking this project, resulting in the inability to detect updates correctly.

We recommend that you follow the steps below to re-deploy:

- Delete the original repo;
- Fork this project;
- Go to the Vercel dashboard, delete the original project, then create a new project and select the project you just forked to redeploy;
- Please manually add an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` and enter your API key as the value during the redeploy process.

This project will be continuously updated, and after forking the project, the upstream code will be automatically synchronized every day without additional operations.

If you want to update instantly, you can check out the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) to learn how to synchronize a forked project with upstream code. 

You can star or watch this project or follow author to get release notifictions in time.

## Access Password

This project provides limited access control. Please add an environment variable named `CODE` on the vercel environment variables page. The value should be passwords separated by comma like this:

```
code1,code2,code3
```

After adding or modifying this environment variable, please redeploy the project for the changes to take effect.

## Environment Variables

### `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required)

Your openai api key.

### `CODE` (optional)
